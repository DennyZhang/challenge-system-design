Q: How LoadBalancer route requests

Generally speaking, load balancers fall into three categories:

- DNS Round Robin (rarely used): clients get a randomly-ordered list of IP addresses.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pros: easy to implement and free; 
cons: hard to control and not responsive, since DNS cache needs time to expire
#+END_EXAMPLE
- L3/L4 Load Balancer: traffic is routed by IP address and port. L3 is network layer (IP). L4 is session layer (TCP).
- L7 Load Balancer: traffic is routed by what is inside the HTTP protocol. L7 is application layer (HTTP).

Typical algorithms:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- round robin, weighted round robin
- least loaded, least loaded with slow start
- utilization limit
- latency, cascade, etc
#+END_EXAMPLE

Commonly used algorithms for HAProxy:

- *roundrobin*: Round Robin selects servers in turns. This is the default algorithm.
- *leastconn*: Selects the server with the least number of connections--it is recommended for longer sessions. Servers in the same backend are also rotated in a round-robin fashion.
- *source*: This selects which server to use based on a hash of the source IP i.e. your user's IP address. This is one method to ensure that a user will connect to the same server.

Q: What are sticky sessions?

Some applications require that a user continues to connect to the same backend server. This persistence is achieved through sticky sessions, using the appsession parameter in the backend that requires it.

how the Readiness Probe is done for backend services?
Often, session tracking is accomplished via a consistent hashing function.
