[[color:#c7254e][Question1: Clarity the requirements from your experience/viewpoints.]]

You can discuss with the interviewer to sort out all vague parts. Or make reasonable assumptions by your own.

Thinkings:
- How much data it should support?
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
A key question for the whole discussion.
#+END_EXAMPLE
- What the read/write OPS would be? 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Better understand the characteristic of service
Thus we can have better estimation for RAM/CPU/Disk usage
#+END_EXAMPLE
- Do we need to keep very old data? 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Data retention. If yes, we usually can have some assumption for the maximum size of the whole data.
#+END_EXAMPLE
- How large the hot data would be? 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Resource planning for RAM
#+END_EXAMPLE

Thinkings:
- Consistent hash
- In RDMBS, B-tree/segment tree
